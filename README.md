# BPDB - The Boiled Peanut DataBase
### And exploration of Web Development and PostGIS (possibly self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi?)

The BPDB was conceived by a group of friends who love boiled peanuts, and wanted to track the availability and quality of boiled peanut dishes offered around Atlanta. In December of 2025, part of the group relocated to North Carolina, necessitating a more atomized approach to BPDC (Boiled Peanut Data Collection). 

This is a personal passion project that involves exploration and learning of a handful of technologies including:
🥜 Raspbian Linux / Linux command line / shell scripting
🥜 Raspberry Pi 5 NAS
🥜 PostgresQL with Post GIS as the database
🥜 Web Development with my usual framework, Svelte(kit)
🥜 Web Mapping with MapLibre + Svelte wrapper

## Planned Features
🥜 Crowdsourced reviews of boiled peanuts on offer at restaurants
🥜 Ability to submit new vendors with geopoint
🥜 Fuzzy matching and location-based discovery of existing vendors
🥜 Dynamically calculated stats on BP quality and value
🥜 Probably much more!
